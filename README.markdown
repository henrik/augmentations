# Augmentations

*Augmentations* is a tiny Rails plugin to easily extend a model (or other class) with instance methods and class methods, as well as running class methods like `belongs_to` at extend time.

It's basically like `include`ing a module, but you can also define class methods and call class methods as you would in the class itself, without (ab)using the `self.included` hook and thus with less boilerplate.

Use it like

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      augment Shared::Pingable, User::PasswordResetExtension
    end

with modules like

    module User::PasswordResetExtension
      augmentation do

        has_many :password_resets

        def self.a_class_method
          # …
        end

        def an_instance_method
          # …
        end

      end
    end

This particular module would be found in `app/models/user/password_reset_extension.rb`.

(If you want to weird things up in the name of fewer lines of code, the Ruby parser will accept

    module User::PasswordResetExtension augmentation do

        …

    end end

too.)
